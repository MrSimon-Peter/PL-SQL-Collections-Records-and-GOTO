# PL-SQL-Collections-Records-and-GOTO
## 1. Problem Definition
### Create a small employee management system in PL/SQL that demonstrates:Collections (Associative Arrays, Nested Tables, and VARRAYs),Records (User-defined, Table-based, and Cursor-based),GOTO statement usage for educational control flow
### This project shows how PL/SQL can handle sets of data and complex structures without using full database tables, ideal for in-memory operations or intermediate processing.

## 2. Learning Objectives
### Understand and use PL/SQL Collection types (Nested Table, Associative Array, VARRAY).
### Work with Record types to store multiple attributes of different data types.
### Demonstrate using Collections and Records together for realistic use cases.
### Apply the GOTO statement safely to jump between labels in a PL/SQL block.
### Document and explain outputs clearly using DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE.

## 4. SQL Implementation
